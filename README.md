# Reducing-data-dimension-boosts-neural-network-based-stage-specific-malaria-detection
* Supplementary data for "Reducing data dimension boosts neural network-based stage-specific malaria detection"
  * "Cell_2cut_NN_LM" contains 1D orthogonal cuts extracted from Giemsa-stained RBC images recorded with light microscopy
  * "Cell_2cut_NN_AFM" contains 1D orthogonal cuts extracted from RBC images recorded with AFM
  * "Cell_2cut_NN_FM" contains 1D orthogonal cuts extracted from RBCs excited at a wavelength of 405 nm
  * "NN_LM" contains the neural network, which was used to classify the light microscopy images
  * "NN_AFM" contains the neural network, which was used to classify the AFM microscopy images
  * "NN_FM" contains the neural network, which was used to classify the fluorescence microscopy images
  * the dataset for testing the networks is located at https://zenodo.org/record/6866337
